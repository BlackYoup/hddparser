## HDD Parser

I had nothing to do for 10 mins and I needed this for a project, so here it is. I'll maybe in an unknow and probably dark future, update this.

## Run

Just run :

		node app.js
		
and it will output all of your files. (You may have to be root or run it with admin privileges to display all files)
