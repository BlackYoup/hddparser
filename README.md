## HDD Parser

I had nothing to do for 10 mins and I needed this for a project, so here it is. I'll maybe in an unknow and probably dark future, update this.

## Run

Just run :

		node app.js
		
and it will output all of your files. (You may use sudo to read system files)

##### Why don't use asynchronous functions and callbacks ? It's the power of node !!

Well, yes but asynchronous wouldn't keep the file parsing order, simple as that.
