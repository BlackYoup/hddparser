## HDD Parser

I had nothing to do for 10 mins and I needed this for a project, so here it is. I'll maybe in an unknow and probably dark future, update this.

## Run

Just run :
		
		npm install
		node app.js
		
and it should open your browser on [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000). From here, you will be able to fetch your hard drive.
